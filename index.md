# Greetings

My name is Tyler Schwartz, I am an aspiring Cybersecurity professional. Currently, I am an IT Technician for a school district, supporting roughly 4000 students and staff. I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in _**Computer Science**_, with an focus in _**Cybersecurity**_. This page is an oppurtunity to track my progress, as well as display my current projects, goals and ideas. 

# What Am I Working On?

Within the next year, my goal is to transition into the Cybersecurity field, specifically within Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC). I am preparing to take the **Security+** exam. Upon passing the exam, I will begin studying for the **Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)**.
